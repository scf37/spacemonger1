SpaceMonger One
---------------

### INTRODUCTION

SpaceMonger is a free tool for keeping track of the disk space on your
computer.  Instead of viewing your disk as unhelpful little icons or
pie charts, you see a single picture that shows you at a glance how
much space every file and folder are using.

### INSTALLATION

Download, unpack, run. Bundled Windows and Linux binaries are provided 
in Releases section, Mac users will have to use cross-platform version 
(Java 24+ is required)

Or run it with JBang on any platform:

`jbang --java 24 https://github.com/scf37/spacemonger1/releases/latest/spacemonger1.jar`

### FIRST-TIME INSTRUCTIONS

SpaceMonger is not a hard program to use.  In fact, you probably won't
need any instructions.  But for those of you who like to read, here are
some first-time instructions:

When you first open SpaceMonger, you will initially be presented with a
blank window.  Click "Open".  Click on a drive, like drive "C", and hit
"OK".  Wait patiently while the program collects statistics on your
drive.  My, don't you have a lot of files!

SpaceMonger will show you the contents of your drive as little
rectangles.  The larger the rectangle, the more space something is taking
up.  Rectangles that have other rectangles in them are folders.
Rectangles with no other rectangles in them are files. Colors are used
to show how deeply the files and folders are nested.

You can get more information on a given folder by clicking on its title
and then clicking "Zoom In" (or by double-clicking on its title).  The
window will change to show a larger, more detailed view of the folder
and its files.  You can zoom in as many times as you want. "Zoom Out"
will take you back out (up) by one folder.  "Zoom Full" will take you
all the way back to show the whole drive.

If you see a file or folder you want to delete, click it to select it
and hit "Delete".  It will be moved to the Recycle Bin.  If you want to
see what it is first, click on it and hit "Run or Open", which will try
to run it if is a program or open it if it is a file.

DISCLAIMER: If you don't know what something is, DON'T DELETE IT.
Deleting things at random is a good way to break your programs or
Windows itself or worse.  'Nuff said.

If you click the "Setup" button, you can change some aesthetic things
about the program.  You can't damage anything with the Setup dialog box,
so feel free to try various options until you like how SpaceMonger looks
and feels.

In addition, you can right-click on a folder or a file to bring up a
context-sensitive menu of options that are identical to those on the
toolbar.  This may be more efficient for some users.

If you double-click on a folder, SpaceMonger will zoom in on it.  If you
double-click on a file (either a program or a document), SpaceMonger
will attempt to run it or open it, whichever is suitable.
